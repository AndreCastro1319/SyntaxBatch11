Wrapper classes:
    Wrapper classes are object classes around primitive data types that have built-in methods and are used as objects where necessary.
    For example in collections framework.
    Wrapper classes provides us a mechanism to use primitive data types as objects.
Boxing:
    The automatic conversion of primitive data types into this equivalent Wrapper is called boxing.
    for example:
    Integer i=new Integer(10);// Boxing
AutoBoxing:
    The automatic conversion of primitive data types into this equivalent Wrapper is called autoboxing.
    for example:
    Integer i=10;// AutoBoxing
Unboxing:
    The conversion of equivalent Wrapper to primitive data types is called unboxing.
    for example:
    Integer i=new Integer(10);//Boxing
    int i2=i.valueOf();//Unboxing
AutoUnboxing:
    The conversion of equivalent Wrapper to primitive data types is called unboxing.
    for example:
    Integer i=10;//AutoBoxing
    int i2=i;//AutoUnboxing
Collection framework:
    The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group
     of objects that represented as a single unit.
     We have many interfaces and classes inside the framework to achieve this.
     ArrayList
     <> diamond operator is used to specify the data type collections framework.
     ArrayList<Double> numbers=new ArrayList<>();
