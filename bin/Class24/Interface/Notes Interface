Interface:
    Interface is collection of public static final variables(constants) and public abstract methods plus static default and private methods from java 8 and 9.
Its a contract that a class has to implement.

Rules:
  1  Can only be public static final fields.
  2  As there are no instance fields in interfaces they don't have constructors as well.
  3  We can not create an object of interfaces because they can have unimplemented methods.
  4  A class can not extend an interface but it is implemented by a class.
  5  An interface can extend another interface
  6  An interface can extend multiple interfaces it means interface support multiple inheritance.

Encapsulation:
    Encapsulation is using data(variables/fields) and code(methods) together as a single unit.
    Create your fields private and make getter and setter methods to access those fields.
    getter and setter methods are used to access and update the value of a private variable
