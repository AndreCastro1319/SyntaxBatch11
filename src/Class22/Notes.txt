Rules for casting objects/classes:
1) We can store a child class object inside a parent type variable
because inheritance is one way from Parent to Child.
2) We can create arrays of type parent and can store all the objects of child classes
inside that array then we can write loops to call all the methods from all the classes.
3) We cannot store/cast a parent class object to child class but if parent type variable
already contains the child object then we can get it back by casting it.
FinalKeyword:
    -If we write "final" with variable we can not change its value either we should initialize it
    right away or throughout the constructor.
    - When used with method we cannot override that method in child class when used with class, no
    class can extend from that class.
