// Access modifiers: Keywords which control the access of members of class(fields/methods/constructors)
// We have four access levels in java and three keywords to control these access levels 
//public/private/protected and default(which is not a keyword)		
// 1) private:
		//if we write private keyword with any class member it can be accessed only in that class
//2)default:
		//if we dont write any keyword with class members we can access those memebers inside the same class
		//and in other class inside the same package
//3)public:
		//if we use public keyword with any class member that member is accessible every where in the project
		//Best practices:
		//always try to declare the fields as private
		//always try to declare the methods as public
